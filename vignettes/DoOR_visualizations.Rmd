Apart from merging data and performing calculations on it, the `DoOR.functions`
package provides several ways to visualize the data served by the `DoOR.data`
package. Please see the [DoOR.function vignette](DoOR.functions.html) for
instructions on how to install and load both functions and data. The plotting
functions can be identified by their common prefix `dplot_`, most of them make
use of the `ggplot2` package which allows to override most, if not all of the
theming options.

## Loading data{#loading}
First we need to load packages and data:
```{r, echo = T, message = TRUE, results='hide'}
#load data
library(DoOR.functions)
library(DoOR.data)
load_door_data(nointeraction = TRUE)
```

## Visualizing odorants _vs_ responding units with `dplot_response_matrix()`
{#responseMatrix}
`dplot_response_matrix()` visualizes the DoOR consensus response matrix either
as a point matrix with the size of the points relating to the response strength,
or as a heatmap, relating color to response strength. The default plot that is
used depends on the data we enter: positive values only (like from
`door_response_matrix` or `door_response_matrix_non_normalized`) which are
scaled `[0,1]` will by default be plotted as a point-matrix. If we provide data
that contains negative values (e.g. data with the spontaneous firing rate set to
0 via `reset_sfr(door_response_matrix, "SFR")`) it will be shown as color-coded
heatmap.

```{r,fig.width=7.1, fig.height=4}
dplot_response_matrix(door_response_matrix[2:50,], tag = "Name", base_size = 8)
```

If the data contains negative values, a colored response matrix will be plotted:
```{r,fig.width=7.1, fig.height=4}
dplot_response_matrix(reset_sfr(door_response_matrix, "SFR")[2:50,], 
                      tag = "Name", base_size = 8)
```

## Visualizing ensemble responses with `dplot_al_map()`{#ALmap}
With `dplot_al_map()` we can visualize the ensemble response a given odorant
elicits across DoOR responding units (receptors, sensory neurons, glomeruli, ...
) as a hypothetical antennal lobe activation pattern.
```{r, fig.width=7.1}
dplot_al_map("QSJXEFYPDANLFS-UHFFFAOYSA-N", base_size = 8)
```
If we do not know the InChIKey of the substance we are interested in, we can use
the `trans_id()` function for conversion. If we are interested in the expressed
receptor rather than the glomerulus names:
```{r, fig.width=7.1, warning=FALSE}
dplot_al_map(trans_id("benzaldehyde", from = "Name"), tag = "receptor", 
             main = "SMILES", base_size = 8)
```

If we prefer the plain activation pattern without annotations at all:
```{r, fig.width=7.1, fig.height=2}
dplot_al_map(trans_id("628-63-7", from = "CAS"), tag = "", main = "", 
             legend = FALSE, scalebar = FALSE)
```

## Visualizing tuning curves with `dplot_tuningCurve()`{#tuningCurve}
### Responding units

The set of odorants a given responding unit is responsive to can be described as
its tuning curve. With `dplot_tuningCurve()` we can easily display such a tuning
curve together with its kurtosis. Kurtosis is a measure of the shape of the
tuning curve, i.e. whether a responding unit is narrowly tuned to a few odorants
(high kurtosis), or whether it responds to many odorants (low kurtosis). The
gaussian distribution has a kurtosis of 0.

If we only specify the receptor/response unit name, the data is taken from
`door_response_matrix` and `dplot_tuningCurve()` uses `reset_sfr()` to reset
spontaneous firing rate (or any other specified odorant) to zero before
plotting.
```{r}
dplot_tuningCurve(receptor = "Or22a", base_size = 8)
```

To prevent resetting by SFR:
```{r}
dplot_tuningCurve(receptor = "Or22a", zero = "", base_size = 8)
```

We can also plot any other vector of responses, once `response.vector` is
specified, the value of `receptor` is only used for the plot title and not for
data lookup anymore:
```{r}
dplot_tuningCurve(receptor = "receptor X", response.vector = c(1:100), 
                  base_size = 8)
```

### Odorants
`dplot_tuningCurve()` can as well be used to visualize the ensemble of
responding units that is activated by a given odorant. Therefore, we specify an
odorant name instead of a response unit name:
```{r}
dplot_tuningCurve(odorant = "PGMYKACGEOXYJE-UHFFFAOYSA-N", base_size = 8)
```

We can specify the chemical identifier to plot via `odor.main`:
```{r}
dplot_tuningCurve(odorant = "PGMYKACGEOXYJE-UHFFFAOYSA-N", odor.main = "SMILES",
                  base_size = 8)
dplot_tuningCurve(odorant = "CURLTUGMZLYLDI-UHFFFAOYSA-N", odor.main = "InChI",
                  base_size = 8)
```

And finally we can control the color of the bars:
```{r}
dplot_tuningCurve(odorant = trans_id("carbon dioxide", from = "Name"), 
                  fill.odorant = "#FF0000", base_size = 8)
```

As mentioned, all of these plots are generated with the ggplot2 package which
allows to override theming:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
dplot_tuningCurve(odorant = trans_id("carbon dioxide", from = "Name"), 
                  base_size = 8) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey", color = "magenta"))
```

## Visualizing response profiles `dplot_response_profile()`{#responseProile}
`dplot_response_profile` creates a horizontal bar plot of the response profile
of a given receptor. It displays the same data as `dplot_tuningCurve` but
focusses on the odorant identity.

Per default the response strength is displayed as bar height as well as color
code:
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=6}
dplot_response_profile("Gr21a.Gr63a", tag = "Name", base_size = 8)
```

We can again omit to reset to SFR:
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=6}
dplot_response_profile("Gr21a.Gr63a", tag = "Name", base_size = 8, zero ="")
```

And if we prefer monochrome data:
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=6}
dplot_response_profile("Gr21a.Gr63a", tag = "CAS", base_size = 8, 
                       colored = FALSE)
```

## Comparing response profiles `dplot_compare_profiles()`{#compareProfiles}
As the name indicates, with `dplot_compare_profiles()` we can plot two response
profiles side by side for comparison. The syntax here differs from the previous
plots as we can use it also to compare the original data sets in DoOR.


### Comparing original data sets
This time, with `x` and `y` we have to specify a whole data.frame, `by.x` and
`by.y`  take the corresponding column names that will be plotted. If `x` is not
specified, both `by.x` and `by.y` will be taken from `x`.

```{r}
dplot_compare_profiles(x = Or22a, y = Or22a, by.x = "Pelz.2006.AntEC50",
                         by.y = "Hallem.2004.EN", tag = "Name", base_size = 8)
```

We see that the measured Or22a sensory neuron responses in these two data sets
are in good accordance.

### Comparing DoOR response profiles
Next we compare two DoOR consensus response profiles, measurements of the
misexpressed receptor Or35a and recordings from the ac3B sensory neuron that
naturally expresses Or35a:
```{r, fig.width = 7.1}
dplot_compare_profiles(
  x = door_response_matrix,
  by.x = "Or35a",
  by.y = "ac3B",
  tag = "Name",
  base_size = 8
  )
```

or with "SFR" set to 0:
```{r, fig.width = 7.1}
dplot_compare_profiles(
  x = reset_sfr(door_response_matrix, "SFR"),
  by.x = "Or35a",
  by.y = "ac3B",
  tag = "Name",
  base_size = 8
  )
```

We see that the response profiles are very similar but not identical, which is
expected as the ac3B neuron expresses other receptors in addition to Or35a.

## Visualizing responses across responding units with `dplot_across_ru()`
{#acrossReceptors}
With `dplot_across_ru()` we can visualize the responses that one or several
odorants elicit across receptors / responding units.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
odors <-
  trans_id(c("pentyl acetate", "carbon dioxide", "2,3-butanedione"), 
           from = "Name")
  dplot_across_ru(odors, tag = "Name", base_size = 8)
```


## Visualizing odorant responses across OSNs with `dplot_across_osns()`
{#across_OSNs}
`dplot_across_osns()` is similar to `dplot_across_ru()` but the responding units
are sorted according to the sensory neuron they belong to. This sorting is
controlled via `door_mappings` from the `DoOR.data` package. There are two types
of plot that `dplot_across_osns()` can return. Type 2 directly resembles
`dplot_across_ru()`:


```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
dplot_across_osns(odors, base_size = 8, plot.type = 2)
```

In type 1 the data is split according to odorant X sensillum, the color is
assigned to the corresponding neuron A-D or X-Z if the neuron's identity is
unknown:
```{r, fig.width = 7.1, fig.height = 5}
dplot_across_osns(odors, base_size = 8, plot.type = 1)
```

As this plot gets pretty messy, we have the option to restrict plotting to
certain subsets of sensilla. We can for example only plot the responses of
antennal basiconic (ab) sensilla:

```{r, fig.width = 7.1, fig.height = 5}
dplot_across_osns(odors, base_size = 8, plot.type = 1, sub = "ab")
```

Or we plot coeloconic and trichoid sensilla:

```{r, fig.width = 7.1, fig.height = 5}
dplot_across_osns(odors, base_size = 8, plot.type = 1, sub = c("ac", "at"))
```
